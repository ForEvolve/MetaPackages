# MetaPackages
This the home of the ForEvolve Framework metapackages.
To be simpler, I created this NuGet package that contains all other ForEvolve packages.
It should be easier to use the ForEvolve Framework without knowing what packages are needed for what.
If you prefer fine-grained package referencing, you can still do it.

**This is still in prototyping mode**
