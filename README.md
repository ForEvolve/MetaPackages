# MetaPackages
This the home of the ForEvolve Framework meta-packages.

To be simpler, I created this repository containing a NuGet package that includes all other ForEvolve packages.
*I may create more meta-packages in the future, hence the plural name of the repository.*

It should be easier to use the ForEvolve Framework without knowing the packages division.
If you prefer fine-grained packages referencing, you can still do it.

**This is still in prototyping mode**
