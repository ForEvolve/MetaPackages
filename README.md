# MetaPackages
This the home of the ForEvolve Framework meta-packages.

This repository contains a project that builds into a NuGet package.
That package includes all other ForEvolve .Net packages.

By referencing this meta-package, it should be easier to use the ForEvolve Framework.
If you prefer fine-grained packages referencing, you can still do it, but you will need to know the packages a little more.

*I may create more meta-packages in the future, hence the plural name of the repository.*

**This is still in prototyping mode**
